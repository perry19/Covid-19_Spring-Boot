Covid-19 Tracking Apllication With Spring boot

Here is a spring boot corona virus tracker application using thymeleaf to render data from a remote covid-19 data source. Apache commons csv is used to parse the csv output. 
Lombok is used to avoid the hassle of creating getters, setters, toString(), etc. 
We equally use bootstrap for styling.
